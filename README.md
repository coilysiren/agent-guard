# agent-guard

A generic-purpose [cli-guard][cli-guard] consumer for repos that take external contributions. Sits between AI agents (or any semi-trusted automation) and the host system, with no maintainer-specific allowlists.

`agent-guard` is to external contributors what [coily][coily] is to Kai's own machines: a thin, audited wrapper around the cli-guard primitives. coily ships personal verbs (homelab SSH, vault paths, deploy hooks). `agent-guard` ships only verbs that make sense to any contributor walking up to a repo cold.

## Status

v0. Not yet wired into any downstream. First adopter target is the urfave/cli namespaced repos ([cli-mcp][cli-mcp], [cli-web-docs][cli-web-docs], [cli-web-ops][cli-web-ops]).

## What it does

Wraps a small, fixed set of dev verbs (`build`, `test`, `vet`, `lint`, `tidy`) behind cli-guard's policy gate. Every invocation:

- validates argv against shell-metacharacter rejection
- writes one append-only JSONL audit row
- binds to a git toplevel via `--commit-scope`
- refuses repo-shaped verbs on a dirty tree

Downstream repos add an `.agent-guard/agent-guard.yaml` listing which Makefile targets are exposed. The contract is verified by `agent-guard lint`.

## Install

Build from source until releases ship:

```
go install github.com/coilysiren/agent-guard/cmd/agent-guard@latest
```

## Usage

```
agent-guard exec build
agent-guard exec test
agent-guard lint
```

See [`docs/`](docs/) for the full verb list and [`examples/`](examples/) for runnable demos.
