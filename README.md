# agent-guard

A generic-purpose [cli-guard][cli-guard] consumer for repos that take external contributions. Sits between AI agents (or any semi-trusted automation) and the host system, with no maintainer-specific allowlists.

`agent-guard` is to external contributors what [coily][coily] is to Kai's own machines: a thin, audited wrapper around the cli-guard primitives. coily ships personal verbs (homelab SSH, vault paths, deploy hooks). `agent-guard` ships only verbs that make sense to any contributor walking up to a repo cold.

## Status

v0. Not yet wired into any downstream. First adopter target is the urfave/cli namespaced repos ([cli-mcp][cli-mcp], [cli-web-docs][cli-web-docs], [cli-web-ops][cli-web-ops]).

## What it does

Wraps a small, fixed set of dev verbs (`build`, `test`, `vet`, `lint`, `tidy`) behind cli-guard's policy gate. Every invocation:

- validates argv against shell-metacharacter rejection
- writes one append-only JSONL audit row
- binds to a git toplevel via `--commit-scope`
- refuses repo-shaped verbs on a dirty tree

Downstream repos add an `.agent-guard/agent-guard.yaml` listing which Makefile targets are exposed. The contract is verified by `agent-guard lint`.

## Install

```
brew tap coilysiren/agent-guard https://github.com/coilysiren/agent-guard
brew install coilysiren/agent-guard/agent-guard
```

The explicit-URL `brew tap` form is required because this repo isn't `homebrew-*` prefixed.

## Usage

```
agent-guard exec build
agent-guard exec test
agent-guard lint
```

See [`docs/`](docs/) for the full verb list and [`examples/`](examples/) for runnable demos.

## Claude Code PreToolUse hook

`agent-guard hook pre-tool-use` is a stdin-driven [Claude Code hook](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks) that does two things:

1. **Binary-path check.** Required by default. When the agent invokes `agent-guard` or `coily` directly, the hook resolves the binary via `command -v` and refuses to let it run unless the resolved path is one of the canonical homebrew install paths. This blocks PATH-hijack attacks where a malicious `agent-guard` or `coily` earlier on `$PATH` would otherwise execute. agent-guard ships with maximum-security defaults; this check is on, no flag, no config.
2. **Routing-hint surface.** Catches bare invocations of wrapped binaries (`make`, `gh`, `aws`, `kubectl`, ...) and surfaces a recovery hint to the agent before it shops other shell shapes. The hint names the wrapper the agent should use. The active table is picked by whether cwd lives under `.agent-guard/agent-guard.yaml` or `.coily/coily.yaml`.

No network, no state. Failure modes (unparseable payload, missing fields, no matching route, binary absent from PATH) pass through silently. Hard denial stays the job of `permissions.deny` in the consuming repo's `.claude/settings.json`.

Register the hook with one command (idempotent, safe to re-run, preserves unrelated keys):

```
agent-guard install-hooks
```

This writes the PreToolUse entry into `<git-toplevel>/.claude/settings.json`. Pass `--path <file>` to target a different settings.json, `--dry-run` to preview the merged content, or `--check` (exit non-zero when the hook is not yet registered, for CI).

Or hand-roll the entry:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          { "type": "command", "command": "agent-guard hook pre-tool-use" }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
