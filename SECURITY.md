## What counts as a vulnerability

agent-guard wraps [cli-guard](https://github.com/coilysiren/cli-guard). Most boundary-level issues belong upstream, not here. Specifically interested in reports of:

- agent-guard verbs that bypass the cli-guard policy gate they claim to install
- audit log entries written by agent-guard that are unparseable, truncatable, or omittable
- `.agent-guard/agent-guard.yaml` parse paths that execute shell or import host state in ways the README does not describe

Out of scope (file as regular issues, not vulnerabilities):

- bare cli-guard framework bugs, report those at [coilysiren/cli-guard](https://github.com/coilysiren/cli-guard/issues)
- bare urfave/cli framework bugs, report those at [urfave/cli](https://github.com/urfave/cli/issues)
